Note that you can "stack" multiple course plans to combine the resources. In the example above, a Small Course (25 students) and a Medium Course (70 students) are combined to provide for a class of 95 students.

Personal subscriptions renew automatically. Course plans do *not* renew automatically.

**To cancel a subscription**, find the subscription in the active subscription list and click ``Cancel`` at the far right.
The subscription will not be auto-renewed at the next renewal date and the expiration date will be displayed in the subscription list.
